Overall programming things

Functions
function test (){
  safsdaf;
}

Every Programming language (that I have learned so far) has some form of these operations inside the code, realizing this may help, especially when moving between languages
if statement
	general if statement if x is true or compare two values to see if they are different or the same do something else do something else
Switch statement (a majority of programming languages have something similar but not all, python only got something like this in the most recent update: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html)
	basically a streamlined if statement that expects specific things and if none of those match default to something
          switch (saf){ 
            case a:
              do things
              break;
	    case b:
	      do other things
	      break;
	    case _:
	      wildcard things
	      return; #return is used in python whereas break is used with javascript 
            }

variables and types
            string
		defined by quotes single or double ' " or `(javascript)
            int
		typical whole number: 4 6 8 45 3241 **NOTE: if a number is in quotes eg. "4" THIS IS A STRING NOT AN INTEGER AND AS SUCH WILL NOT BE TREATED AS A NUMBER
            floating point number also known as a float
		number with a decimal: 4.0 6.3 6.75 64.54 **NOTE: if a number is in quotes eg. "4.0" THIS IS A STRING NOT A FLOAT AND AS SUCH WILL NOT BE TREATED AS A NUMBER
            array (list)
		an array is a variable that holds mulitple values (not to be confused with variable method in javascript or an object of a class in python(more on this later!!)) and certain things can be accessed by using a number eg. variable[2] (starts at 0 instead of 1 so this gets the value in 
		the third position variable = ['w', 'a', 's', 'd']
		are equal to positions	       [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  so variable[2] would return 's'
		)
while loops
	while x is true or when comparing two values, as long as the result is true, do the following until the result is false
		a = 1 b = 1	
		while a == b
			print "hello" ## outputs the word "hello" infinitely
	but if we set 
		b = 2
		while a == b
			print "hello" ##outputs nothing as a is not equal to b
	numbers can be changed within the loop to create a limited number of outputs
		a = 1 b = 1	
		while a == b 
			print "hello"
			b = b + 1 ##this will print hello only once as they started equal but then 1 was added to b making b = 2 and making it false

	nested while loops
		while loops can be placed within another while loop allowing for a grid pattern or points to possibly be made
			u=0
			while u < 5:  #0
    				r=0
    				while r < 10:  #10
        				print(u,r)
						#this will output the following until it reaches 10 with 0,9 being the last output before it becomes 1,0 its kind of confusing to visualize but you can put this into a py file and run it to see the result
        					#0,0
        					#0,1
        					#0,2
        				r = r + 1
    				u = u + 1


console output
	outputs the result to the console useful for diagnosing issues or for having a user read something on the screen
	in javascript this is console.log(), in python it is print()
	other languages may use something different but core functionality of outputting to the console is the same



Ignore for now:
	class
	Private class
	Public class

	read file
	write file
	multifile programming
